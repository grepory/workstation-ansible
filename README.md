# workstation-ansible

## What?

I do not particularly enjoy setting up my workstations. So, in an effort to
learn ansible and automate setting up workstations simultaneously, I made
this. It is intended to be as painless as possible.

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/grepory/workstation-ansible.git
cd workstation-ansible
./bootstrap-osx.sh
```
